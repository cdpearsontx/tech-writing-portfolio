# Optimizing Event Flyers for Accessibilty

_A step-by-step guide on designing, formatting, and exporting accessible event flyers_

## Why Accessibility Matters
- Ensures everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can access your event details
- Increases audience engagement and compliance with ADA guidelines


## Step 1: Choosing the Right Design Software
### Recommend Tools
- **Adobe InDesign** (Best for professional layout)
- **Adobe Illustrator** (Better for graphical flyers with live text)
- **Microsoft Word / Google Docs** (For text-heavy event posters)



## Step 2. Best Practices for Accessible Flyer Design
### Use High-Contrast Colors
- Dark text on a light background (or light text on dark background)
- Avoid combinations like **red & green** (color blindness issue)
- Use **contrast checkers** (WebAim Contrasst Checker, Adobe Color)



### Use Readable Fonts
- **Sans-serif** (Arial, Helvetica, Calibri) are best
- Avoid **script or decorative fonts** for key detials
- Minimum **font size**: 14pt for general text, 18+ for important details

### Ensure Text is Selectable
- **DO NOT** embed text in an image to convey your message
- Use **live text layers** in InDesign or Illustrator instead of flattening the text as in Photoshop



## Step 3: Exporting as an Accessible PDF
### Adobe InDesign / Illustrator Export Settings
- **Enable "Create Tagged PDF"** (important for event links & registration)
- **Optimize for the Fast Web View** (for easy online sharing)

### Checking PDF Accessibility
- Open in **Adobe Acrobat Pro DC**
- Use **Accessibility Checker**
- Test with **NVDA screen reader**



## Step 4: Sharing the Flyer
- Attach the **PDF version**, not just an image of the flyer
- Provide **plain text alternative** in the event description
- If sharing on social media, **include event details in the post text**


## Final Tips
- Always **test readbility & contrast** before publishing
- Use **alt text** for images when applicable
- Offer a **text-only version** on the event webpage or typed out in the body of an email message
