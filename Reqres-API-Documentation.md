# Reqres API Documentation

## About This Documentation

This document provides reference and example usage for the [Reqres](https://reqres.in) mock API, a public REST API designed for practicing and testing front-end and back-end HTTP requests.

The documentation was created for educational purposes to demonstrate API structure, endpoint behavior, request/response formatting, and technical writing best practices.

All endpoints have been tested using Postman, with example requests and JSON responses included. This document was authored in Markdown and structured to follow industry-standard patterns for API reference guides, including:

- HTTP method and endpoint descriptions  
- Parameter tables  
- Request/response examples  
- Notes and expected behavior for edge cases

The project serves as part of a growing technical writing portfolio, showcasing skills in API documentation, JSON formatting, and Markdown structuring.
