# Spotify Web API â€“ Artist Lookup & Discovery Flow

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to authenticate with the Spotify Web API and retrieve artist data, including albums and top tracks. It uses the Client Credentials Flow and the following endpoints:

- Search Artist
- Get Artist Albums
- Get Artist Top Tracks

`https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token` 

**Headers (Basic Auth):**
  - Username: your Client ID
  - Password: your Client Secret

**Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):**

| --- | --- |
|grant_type | client_credentials |

**Response**

```json
{
    "access_token": "BQD...yourtoken..",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

## Endpoint (Search)
